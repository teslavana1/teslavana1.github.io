                I’m a Software Engineer shifting over from over 8 years of mechanical engineering experience. I've completed a 65+ hour web development bootcamp, which covered HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express, and a 45+ hour ReactJS bootcamp that included ReactJS, MUI, NextJS, and Express. Since then, I've spent 200+ hours working on my own projects.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant='body1' marginBottom={0}>I enjoy learning new skills and honing them through real-world applications. I’m excited to apply my mechanical engineering and product development experience to my career as a Software Engineer.
